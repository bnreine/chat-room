# bloc-chat-react

This is a single page web messaging application with user authentication, chat rooms, and associated messages.  I built this using create-react-app, react, and firebase (database and authentication).  Click on a chat room to see the messages inside of it.  In order to send messages, you need to sign in using your google account.  You can find the deployed site here: https://bnreine-bloc-chat-react.herokuapp.com/
